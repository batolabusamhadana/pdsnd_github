Bikeshare Project

### Description
The Bikeshare Project allows users to analyze bikeshare data for cities such as Chicago, New York, and Washington. Users can choose the city, apply filters based on time periods (month or day), and view important statistics related to bike usage, including popular stations, trip duration, and user demographics. This project uses data from the Bike Share program in these cities to offer insights on bike sharing trends.
